# LangGraph Agent â€“ Retail

**LangGraph-Agent-Retail** is an **AI-powered retail product recommendation and search agent** built using [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph) and modern LLM tooling.  
It leverages **multi-agent reasoning**, **vector search**, and **natural language understanding** to deliver personalized product suggestions, comparison reasoning, and preference-based filtering for retail catalogs.

This project is designed for **retail AI prototyping** and can be deployed as an API or an interactive [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io) application.
